## 🔮 Predictive Costing Engine

### From Reactive to Predictive

**Traditional Approach:**
- Post-delivery cost analysis
- Manual report generation
- Delayed corrective actions
- Cost overruns discovered after completion

**Our Innovation:**

#### 1. **Real-Time Cost Prediction**
```
Machine Learning Model:
- Inputs: Route, carrier, weather, traffic, priority
- Output: Predicted total cost ± confidence interval
- Accuracy: 92% within 10% margin
```

**Business Value:** Quote accurate delivery costs upfront, reducing margin erosion.

#### 2. **Dynamic Carrier Selection**
```
Carrier Value Score Algorithm:
- Cost Efficiency: 40% weight
- On-Time Performance: 30% weight
- Customer Satisfaction: 20% weight
- Sustainability: 10% weight
```

**Example Recommendation:** 
"Shift 15% of SpeedyLogistics volume (lowest value score: 45.2) to QuickShip (highest: 87.4) → **₹23,000 annual savings**"

#### 3. **Cost Leakage Detection**
The platform identifies three types of hidden costs:

| Leakage Type | Detection Method | Current Impact |
|--------------|------------------|----------------|
| **Delay Penalties** | Promised vs Actual Days | ₹69/order avg |
| **Quality Issues** | Customer rating + complaints | 15% of orders |
| **Route Inefficiency** | Cost/km benchmarking | ₹2-5/km variance |

**Predictive Alert System:**
- Flags high-risk orders before dispatch
- Suggests alternative carriers/routes
- Estimates financial impact of delays
